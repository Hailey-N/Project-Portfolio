This was tough to read through due to the nature of the book's content combined with the author's writing style. There were a few parts in the book that I did not care for, as I felt that they added no value or were out of context with the events the author was trying to describe.

Absolutely brilliant! I loved everything about this book. The banter, the witty remarks, & everything in between. I'm so glad I read the book after watching the movie, because the movie did help me visualize the characters and their situations much better when compared to the book. I loved the writing style as I haven't read too many books whose character's stories are written through IMs, letters, Emails, etc. I found it quite charming and unique. I loved seeing the characters grow up through all their written messages. Ahern did a wonderful job captivating me with Love, Rosie. I'm looking forward to reading more of her work. :0)",1
